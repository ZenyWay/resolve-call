`Promise.resolve` for functions:
turn any function into one that runs when its arguments are resolved,
and write async code that reads like synchronous code.

# <a name="example"></a> example
```ts
import resolve from '../../src'
const { fetch } = require('fetch-ponyfill')()
import debug = require('debug')
const log = resolve(debug('example:'))

const getJson = resolve((result: any) => // extract JSON from fetch result
  result && (typeof result.json === 'function') && result.json())

const getUser = resolve((users: any) => // extract user object from randomuser api result
  Array.isArray(users.results) && users.results[0])

const users = getJson(fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/?inc=name,email,dob&noinfo')) // Promise
const user = getUser(users) // Promise
log(user) // { "dob": "...", "email": "...", "name": { ... } }
```
the files of this example are available [here](./spec/example).

a live version of this example can be viewed [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/resolve-call/v1.0.0/spec/example/index.html)
in the browser console,
or by cloning this repository and running the following commands from a terminal:
```bash
npm install
npm run example
```

# <a name="api"></a> API v1.0 stable
`ES5` and [`Typescript`](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) compatible.
coded in `Typescript 2`, transpiled to `ES5`.

```ts
function resolve <T>(fn: (...args: any[]) => T|Promise<T>): (...args: any[]) => Promise<T>
```

throws a `TypeError` "argument is not a function" when `fn` is not a function.

for a detailed specification of the API,
run the [unit tests](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/resolve-call/v1.0.0/spec/web/index.html)
